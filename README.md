# JSONParsingExampleApp

In this project, I implemented a simple example of parsing JSON and displaying an image from the Internet on the screen. I do not use architectural patterns, and the main logic code is written in the ViewController class. The purpose of the project is to show the implementation of network requests, so do not pay attention to other points.
